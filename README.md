>To install this application, use Git Bash to clone this project's repo to your local machine. If there are any issues cloning the repo, refer to the GitHub docs: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository 
 
## Usage information 
<a name="usage"></a>  
 
>After cloning down the repo for this project and installing VS Code and Node, open the repo directory in VS Code. After opening VS Code, open an integrated Git Bash terminal and run the command "node index.js." This will run the prompts to create a new file and output the created file to the output folder. Keep in mind that there is only one output file present in the folder at any given time, and the file should be copied before running the program again to prevent overwriting.
